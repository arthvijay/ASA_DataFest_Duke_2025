“We wanted to investigate whether Class A office spaces—especially those occupied by tech companies—were more resilient during times of economic stress. We define resilience through stable occupancy, leasing activity, and rental rates. Using a proprietary commercial real estate dataset provided by Savills, we filtered for Class A vs. non-Class A spaces, and tech vs. non-tech tenants. By comparing these groups across quarters and against unemployment trends, we discovered how differently these segments respond to broader market shocks.”
